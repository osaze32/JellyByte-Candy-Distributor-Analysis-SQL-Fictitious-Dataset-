# Project Overview
**JellyByte** is a global confectionery company known for producing and distributing a wide range of popular candies across international markets. With a strong presence in multiple countries, the company is exploring opportunities to expand its operations further based on regional performance.

This project was conducted to analyze the sales performance of JellyByte’s **United States operations**. The project aims to identify top-performing distributors, regional trends, and product-specific demand patterns. Insights from this analysis will inform strategic decisions regarding potential expansion, resource allocation, and market-specific improvements. The findings will be presented to JellyByte’s executive team and regional managers.

# Data Structure
The dataset consists of three tables, **Products**, which contains details of all products offered by JellyByte, **Targets**, which outlines sales targets for each product division, and **Sales**, which records transactions from January 2021 to December 2024. Together, these tables support a focused analysis of sales performance and target achievement in the U.S. market.

# Executive Summary
- This analysis examined sales transactions from **2021 to 2024** across all five JellyByte factories operating in the United States, with a focus on both sales performance and product trends. Over the four-year period, JellyByte generated **141,783.63** in total sales, with **2024 emerging as the strongest year** at **46,968.11**, reflecting a **27% increase** from 2023.
- Seasonal trends revealed that **sales peaked from August to December**, with **December achieving the highest monthly averages** and **February the lowest**. This indicates a clear **year-end demand surge**, likely linked to holiday-driven consumption.
- The **Wonka Bar range** overwhelmingly dominated the product portfolio, occupying the **top five spots by sales** and recording over **1,900 orders per flavor**. In contrast, other products, including Wonka Gum, contributed minimally to overall revenue. The **Chocolate division** accounted for nearly all sales, while **Sugar** and **Other** divisions underperformed—none of the three divisions met their **2024 sales order targets**.
- From a geographic perspective, the **Pacific region** led with **46,301.53** in sales, while the **Gulf region** lagged. **California, New York, and Texas** were the top three states, together representing a significant share of U.S. sales. Factory performance was similarly concentrated, with **Lot’s O’ Nuts** and **Wicked Choccy’s** generating the majority of revenue.
- Overall, the findings highlight **strong flagship product performance**, **seasonal growth opportunities**, and **geographic sales concentration**, but also reveal **divisional imbalances** and underutilized factory capacity—areas that present opportunities for targeted growth strategies.

# Key Insights
The following insights are based on an analysis of sales transactions from all five JellyByte factories operating in the United States. The analysis examines both overall sales performance and product-level trends, highlighting key patterns, strengths, and areas for potential improvement in the U.S. market.

### Sales Analysis
- Between **2021 and 2024**, JellyByte’s U.S. operations generated a **total sales value of 141,783.63**, reflecting a steadily improving performance over time. Notably, **2024 emerged as the best-performing year**, achieving **46,968.11** in sales—an **increase of 10,108.79** compared to **2023’s 36,859.32**. This upward momentum underscores the brand’s growing market traction in the U.S.
- Looking at monthly trends, the **average total sales from 2021 to 2024 remained relatively stable**, yet distinct seasonal shifts were evident. **February consistently posted the lowest monthly average (13.11)**, while **December reached the highest (14.45)**. Sales from **January to June generally trended lower**, with subtle fluctuations or declines, whereas **August to December consistently outperformed**, signaling a clear **demand surge in the latter part of the year**—likely tied to holiday consumption patterns.
- From a product standpoint, **the Wonka Bar range dominated the market**, capturing the **entire top five positions** by sales. **Wonka Bar – Triple Dazzle Caramel** led with **28,485** in total sales, while **Wonka Bar – Nutty Crunch Surprise** recorded the lowest among the range at **23,574.95**. Other products, including **Wonka Gum**, registered significantly smaller contributions, reinforcing that **the majority of revenue hinges on the Wonka Bar line**.
- At the divisional level, the **Chocolate division was overwhelmingly dominant**, generating **131,692.9** in sales. This dwarfed the **Other division** at **9,742** and the **Sugar division** at just **348.73**, indicating highly concentrated performance in one product category.
- When assessing factory performance, **Lot’s O’ Nuts emerged as the leading facility**, delivering **76,340.15** in total sales. **Wicked Choccy’s** followed with **55,352.75**, while **Secret Factory** contributed **8,587.5**. The remaining two factories—**The Other Factory** and **Sugar Shack**—posted minimal figures of **1,282.25** and **220.98**, respectively, suggesting room for significant operational improvement or portfolio reevaluation.
- Geographically, the **Pacific region** topped the charts with **46,301.53** in sales, while the **Gulf region** lagged at **22,247.26**. The **Atlantic** and **Interior** regions performed solidly, with **41,197.24** and **32,037.6**, respectively. At the state level, **California (27,917.4)**, **New York (15,541.03)**, and **Texas (13,416.09)** emerged as the top three revenue generators, emphasizing the strategic importance of these markets.
- Finally, in logistics, **Standard Class shipping** stood out as the preferred delivery method, accounting for **6,120 orders**. This suggests customer preference for cost-effective shipping, though it may also reflect internal fulfillment policies.

### **Product Analysis**
- The **Wonka Bar range** stands as the undisputed leader in JellyByte’s U.S. product lineup. Each flavor recorded **over 1,900 orders**, significantly surpassing the order volumes of all other products. This dominance highlights a **strong and consistent consumer preference** for the Wonka Bar among American customers, reinforcing its position as the company’s flagship product in the U.S. market.
- However, performance against **2024 sales order targets** tells a different story. **None of the three product divisions**—Chocolate, Sugar, or Other—achieved their annual targets for total sales orders. This shortfall signals potential gaps in either **demand generation, distribution reach, or product portfolio diversification**, and may warrant a targeted strategy to address division-specific challenges.

# Recommendations
- The marketing department need to leverage Wonka Bar dominance to drive higher demands and also carry out analysis or survey to identify more flavours that are likely to appeal to the tastes of most americans
- The company should consider rebranding some of its low performing products and using the already established brand identity of Wonka Bar to create more awareness to its other products
- The company should also consider focusing its resources only on the wonka bar range in other to reduce product cost and free up resources. This should be done if there is no enough resources to carry out a rebranding and also a marketing campaign
- Strengthen distribution and marketing efforts in **California, New York, and Texas**, which already drive the highest sales. Replicate successful regional strategies from the **Pacific region** into lower-performing areas like the **Gulf region**.
- Audit underperforming facilities such as **Sugar Shack** and **The Other Factory** to identify production, demand, or supply chain issues and also consider closure in the case of underperforming factories
